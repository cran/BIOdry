New change in BIOdry V0.9:
We added labels to items in three files: Pchron.Rd, Prec.Rd, and Temp.Rd

New change in BIOdry V0.8:

Changes in "shiftFrame": We have used stringAsFactors = TRUE in 
internal implementation of data.frame().

New changes in BIOdry V0.7:
convergence errors have been fixed

New changes in BIOdry V0.6:

Examples of the functions have been changed to solve convergence
errors.


New changes in BIOdry V0.5:

1. Five S3 methods were developed: "anova.modelFrame",
"plot.modelFrame", "plot.muleMan", "plot.wlai", and
"summary.modelFrame" (see package documentation).

2. Changes in function "modelFrame": This function processes now two
formats of dendroclimatic records: dendroclimatic chronologies or
multilevel data series. Examples to implement this function were
improved (see package documentation).

3. Changes in function "muleMan": Examples to implement this function
were improved (see package documentation).

4. Three new binary data sets: "Pchron.RData", "Prec.RData", and
"Temp.RData" were added to examples in data/ folder. These contains
dendroclimatic chronologies which are described in the package
documentation.

5. New "mUnits" function to change metric units in dendroclimatic
chronologies is added to the package.

6. Change in function "amod": Routines to develop allometric scaling
were enhanced (see package documentation).

7. New "cClclass" function replaces old "colclass" function (see
package documentation).

Changes in BIOdry V0.4:

1. Changes in function "tdForm": incorrect formulation of this
 time-decline form was fixed (see package documentation).

2. Changes in function "ringLme": This function has been replaced by
frametoLme() to improve implementation of lme function in nlme package
(see package documentation).


Changes in BIOdry V0.3:

1. Changes in function "shiftFrame": Algorithm to shift ring-data
   frames into multilevel data frames was changed to fix Internal
   error message (R < 3.2.0). A new default argument "lev.nm =
   c('plot','tree','sample')" was added to the function. This argument
   provides names of the factor-level columns in the reshaped
   multilevel data frames (see package documentation).
 
2. Changes in function "muleMan": Output of this function is now a
   "groupedData" object. Default plot in the output was removed. The
   two default plot arguments: "plot.man = TRUE" and "psig = 0.05"
   were also removed. Users of the package can plot the groupedData
   object with other trellis-graph functions (see examples in the
   function).
