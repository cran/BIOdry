New changes in BIOdry V0.4:

1. Changes in function "tdForm": incorrect formulation of this
 time-decline form was fixed (see package documentation).

2. Changes in function "ringLme": This function has been replaced by
frametoLme() to improve implementation of lme function in nlme package
(see package documentation).


New changes in BIOdry V0.3:

1. Changes in function "shiftFrame": Algorithm to shift ring-data
   frames into multilevel data frames was changed to fix Internal
   error message (R < 3.2.0). A new default argument "lev.nm =
   c('plot','tree','sample')" was added to the function. This argument
   provides names of the factor-level columns in the reshaped
   multilevel data frames (see package documentation).
 
2. Changes in function "muleMan": Output of this function is now a
   "groupedData" object. Default plot in the output was removed. The
   two default plot arguments: "plot.man = TRUE" and "psig = 0.05"
   were also removed. Users of the package can plot the groupedData
   object with other trellis-graph functions (see examples in the
   function).
